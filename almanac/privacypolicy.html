<p>Below is the privacy policy for the 
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.velocitizer.personal.almanac">Personal Almanac</a>.
We take your privacy seriously. We've had our personal data stolen and hacked just as you have.

<p>
The best way we can keep your data safe is to never send it to our servers.
The best way we can keep from having your data stolen from us is to never collect it in the first place.
We don't want your data, we have enough of our own. 
</p>
<p>
Now, just like most mobile application we collect anonymous usage statistics.
These are collected from your day-to-day interactions with this software in an 
effort to know where new features should be added and bugs should be squashed. 
Your continued use of Personal Almanac is your consent for the collecdtion of this anonymous usage data. 

</p>
<p>
Your almanac entries are only yours. These are stored on your mobile device.
If you have chosen to link a Google Calendar, your entries are still only yours. 
Once linked your entries will be sent to the Google Calendar you chose.
That being said, Personal Almanac is configured for App Backup with Google.
This is in the event that you purchase a new phone, this application and it's data can be
automatically restored to your new device. This is not a complete solution. For users with
enormous amounts of almanac entries, the auto backup functionality built into Android 
may prove insuficient. We will be monitoring those anonymous usage statistics for the need
to introduce alterate backup approaches.
</p>
<p>
The storage of your almanac entries on your phone is not encrypted. If someone has
access to your phone, they might extract your almanac entries in the same way they
might extract and gain access to all the other data stored on your device.
